# Staking Options

Staking Options is a library for use in the Dual Finance ecosystem. One of the
core beliefs of Dual Finance is that options are a strictly better incentive for
projects than just token rewards. Options better align incentives between
participants and the project. Staking Options is a program that helps projects
convert existing incentives and create new pathways to leverage option based
rewards. The local validator tests in this repo should serve as a reference
implementation.

## How to integrate for projects

Use the [staking-options-sdk](https://github.com/Dual-Finance/staking-options-sdk).
Example integration in realms. Configure, then issue tokens, then withdraw after
expiration.

## Users
Users who receive options can go to [dual.finance](dual.finance) and exercise their options whenever they want before expiration. We are focused on delivering a market for the staking options themselves if users want to immediately sell their options to stablecoins, rather than hold them to expiration.
